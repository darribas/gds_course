We start with an introduction on *what* geovisualisation is; then we follow with the modifiable areal unit problem, a key concept to keep in mind when displaying statistical information spatially; and we wrap up with tips to make awesome choropleths, thematic maps. Each section contains a short clip and a set of slides, plus a few (optional) readings."

Although technically, it is easy to create choropleths, it is even easier to make *bad* choropleths. Fortunately, there are a few principles that we can follow to create effective choropleths.
