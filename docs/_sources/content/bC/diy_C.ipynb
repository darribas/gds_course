    "1. Separate streets named after men from those named after women, perhaps in two objects (`men`, `women`) that contain the streets for each group. This is a non-spatial query at its heart, so make sure to revisit {ref}`that section on the previous block <lab_B:condition_queries>`.\n",

    "1. Create a total length by group by adding the lengths of each street. This is again a non-spatial operation (sum), so make sure to re-read {ref}`this part <lab_B:new_columns>` of Block B.\n",
