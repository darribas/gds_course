This is a score that ranks LSOAs (the same polygons we used in [block C](../bC/diy_C)) by the proximity to features of the environment that are considered positive for health (assets) and negative (hazards). The resulting number gives us a sense of how \"unhealthy\" the environment of the LSOA is. The higher the score, the less healthy the area is assessed to be.\n",
